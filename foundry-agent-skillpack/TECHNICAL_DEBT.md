# Technical Debt

Tracked gaps and trade-offs in the foundry-agent-skillpack APM package. Each entry: what / why deferred / what would close it.

> **Rename history:**
> - **v0.18.0 (May 2026):** package renamed from `foundry-agent-engineering` → `foundry-agent-harness`.
> - **v0.19.0 (May 2026):** package renamed from `foundry-agent-harness` → `foundry-agent-skillpack`. `aliases: [foundry-agent-harness]` ships in v0.19.x and stays through v0.20.0 (TD-2 + TD-10 close-out release); slated to drop in v0.20.x / v0.21.0. See [TD-19](#td-19--package-rename-foundry-agent-harness--foundry-agent-skillpack).

## TD-1 — Fabric workspace role assignment is print-only

**What:** `/configure-rbac` prints the Fabric portal/REST steps to add the per-agent identity as a workspace `Member` instead of executing the call.

**Why deferred:** The Fabric `POST /workspaces/{id}/roleAssignments` API requires a Fabric-aud delegated token (`api.fabric.microsoft.com/.default`), not an `https://management.azure.com/.default` token from `az`. Acquiring it cleanly inside an APM prompt requires either:
- A Service Principal that already has `Fabric Administrator` (chicken-and-egg), or
- An interactive `az login --scope api.fabric.microsoft.com/.default` flow that disrupts the prompt flow.

**Close-out:** Detect if the user is a Fabric admin (Graph: `directoryRoles` for `Fabric Administrator`); if so, prompt for explicit `az login --scope` and call the API. Otherwise stay print-only.

## ~~TD-2 — Teams publish orchestration~~ **(CLOSED in v0.20.0)**

**Status (v0.20.0):** Closed. The new-model identity-flip gap is now orchestrated by [`/publish-teams`](.apm/prompts/publish-teams.prompt.md) + [`/configure-rbac post_publish=true`](.apm/prompts/configure-rbac.prompt.md), backed by:

- [foundry-teams-workiq/publish-flow.md](.apm/skills/foundry-teams-workiq/publish-flow.md) — full flow documentation (preflight, agent.yaml patch, publish CLI handoff, identity-flip capture, RBAC re-fan, M365 admin runbook).
- [foundry-teams-workiq/scripts/preflight-publish.sh](.apm/skills/foundry-teams-workiq/scripts/preflight-publish.sh) — hard-gates `BotService` RP registration, `BYO_VNET_PUBLIC_BOT_MISMATCH`, continuous-eval rule presence, Purview enablement, and publish-metadata secret scan.
- [foundry-teams-workiq/scripts/refan-rbac-post-publish.sh](.apm/skills/foundry-teams-workiq/scripts/refan-rbac-post-publish.sh) — resolves the application identity and emits the exact `/configure-rbac post_publish=true` invocation.
- New `publish` section in [agent-status-schema.md](.apm/skills/foundry-deploy/agent-status-schema.md#publish--written-by-publish-teams-and-configure-rbac---post-publish-td-2) (schema v1.1, additive). `agent_status.py` `ALLOWED_SECTIONS` extended.
- `/configure-rbac` `post_publish` input added: skips Phase 1/2, re-fans Phase 3 grants against `publish.application_identity_principal_id`, writes to `rbac.capability_grants_post_publish` (preserves pre-publish state for audit), stamps `publish.rbac_refanned_at`.

**Legacy branch:** Agents with `identity == null` still print the existing `teamsapp` runbook from [foundry-teams-workiq/SKILL.md § Channel publishing](.apm/skills/foundry-teams-workiq/SKILL.md#channel-publishing--post-deploy-steps-print-to-user). When the upstream upgrade gesture for legacy → new agents GAs (currently "Coming soon" per MS Learn), this branch drops — tracked under quarterly verification.

**Original gap (largely obsoleted upstream):** `foundry-teams-workiq` SKILL printed the `teamsapp` CLI commands to build a Teams app .zip but did not execute them.

**Why obsoleted:** Foundry portal vNext (Early Access Preview) ships a **Direct Publish to Teams / M365 Copilot** button that auto-creates the Azure Bot Service resource and dispatches the M365 admin approval workflow. For agents on the new agent object model (`agent.identity != null`), the manifest-packaging chore that TD-2 was scoped to handle is no longer the customer-facing problem. ([MS Learn: Publish agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/publish-copilot))

**New gap declared (the surface widened, not narrowed):** Publishing flips the agent's runtime identity from the project identity to a new application identity. MS Learn (verbatim): *"Plan for identity changes when you publish. Tool calls authenticated by agent identity use the application identity after publishing, not the project identity."* ([Publish your agent as an Agent Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/agent-applications)) Every RBAC grant `/configure-rbac` made pre-publish breaks unless re-fanned. This is the new TD-2-shaped problem.

**Close-out (new):** Ship a `/publish-teams` prompt that handles the broader publish event:
1. Detect new vs legacy agent object model (`agent.identity` null check).
2. Legacy path: keep existing `teamsapp` runbook until the upstream upgrade gesture ships ("Coming soon" per MS Learn).
3. New path:
   - Preflight `Microsoft.BotService` provider registration in the subscription.
   - Configure Activity protocol + BotService / BotServiceRbac authorization scheme on `agent.yaml` (required for M365/Teams publish per MS Learn).
   - Detect BYO-VNet ↔ public Bot Service mismatch.
   - Scan publish metadata (display name, descriptions, URLs) for accidental secrets — MS Learn explicitly warns.
   - Gate publish on `/setup-evals` pass + `/setup-purview` middleware presence.
   - On post-publish: `/configure-rbac --post-publish` to re-fan the RBAC matrix from project identity to the new application identity.
   - Capture publish event as a delta in `agent-status.json` for `/audit-drift`.
   - Emit M365 admin approval runbook for "People in your organization" scope (admin center URL + paste-ready Teams message for the admin).

**Verification (track quarterly):** Re-check MS Learn for the legacy-agent upgrade gesture GA — once shipped, drop the legacy-path branch.

**Deck revisit required after merge:** Update Approach A Slide 4 — move Teams items from the ⚠ hand-off list into the ✓ orchestration list with implementation evidence. Update Approach B Slide 5 Card 2 to reference the shipped `/publish-teams` prompt (not "roadmap"). Update `00-objective-and-problem.md` open-in-flight to mark `/publish-teams` shipped.

## TD-3 — WorkIQ "is agent registered" check is beta API

**What:** `/verify-agent` uses `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/people/agents` to confirm Agent 365 inventory.

**Why:** No GA endpoint exists yet for programmatic Agent 365 inventory.

**Close-out:** Replace with GA endpoint when available (track Graph release notes).

## TD-4 — Foundry-native DLP is preview-limited (PARTIAL CLOSE in v0.16.0)

**What:** `purview.dlp.enabled: true` in the capabilities manifest prints a hard warning and stops; full SIT scanning + label enforcement requires Purview SDK middleware which is not part of this package.

**Status (v0.16.0):** Partially closed by shipping the **Layer 1.5 Purview DLP middleware** under [foundry-guardrails/purview-dlp.md](.apm/skills/foundry-guardrails/purview-dlp.md) + [scripts/purview_dlp_middleware.py](.apm/skills/foundry-guardrails/scripts/purview_dlp_middleware.py). The middleware:
- Calls Purview classification API per turn (input + response, optionally tool results).
- Acts on the verdict per `enforcement_mode`: `audit_only` | `warn` | `block`.
- Defaults to `audit_only` (always safe, fail-open on classifier errors).
- Requires explicit `AGREE_PURVIEW_DLP_PREVIEW=1` env var to start in `block` mode (constructor refuses without it).
- Emits structured OTel spans (`guardrail.purview_dlp.*`) for KQL + dashboards.

**Why not full close:** Three preview-grade gaps remain that require Purview-side GA:
1. **Token surface uncertainty.** The Purview classification API may require a Compliance-Admin-tier token for some tenants. Middleware uses `DefaultAzureCredential`; if your tenant requires elevated rights, you accept the risk of the secret in agent env vars.
2. **Label propagation through OBO.** Sensitivity labels in source documents only appear in classification responses when the source surfaces them via OBO (M365 path). For Foundry-hosted with `acl_passthrough: false`, only labels embedded in the prompt/response text are detected.
3. **API shape stability.** The `/classify` endpoint shape is preview-adjacent. If the shape changes, the middleware's `_classify` method needs swapping (rest of the middleware is shape-agnostic).

**Close-out:** Re-validate against Purview GA docs (daily docs scan flags surface changes); promote to full close when (1)–(3) above resolve.

## TD-5 — `apm.yml` has no `repository:` cross-link to skills

**What:** Skills do not declare individual `repository:` URLs; they share the package's.

**Why:** APM does not require it.

**Close-out:** Add `repository:` to each skill front-matter when the package crosses 1.0.

## TD-6 — No CI gate runs `apm install` against external consumer projects

**What:** `.github/workflows/apm-install-test.yml` validates the package resolves but does not validate that a typical consumer project can `apm install` + `apm compile -t copilot` cleanly.

**Close-out:** Add a `consumer-smoke` matrix job that creates a fresh repo, declares this package as a dep, and runs `apm install` + `apm audit` + `apm compile`.

## TD-7 — Agent identity propagation timing is not handled gracefully

**What:** Several gates note "RBAC propagation: 5–15 minutes" but `/verify-agent` runs immediately after `/configure-rbac`, often hitting 403.

**Close-out:** Add `--wait-for-rbac` flag that polls a known endpoint until success or 20 min timeout, with backoff.

## TD-8 — `azure-ai-projects` SDK surface drift

**What:** The `foundry-evals/scripts/ensure_*.py` wrappers call `evaluation_rules.create_or_update`, `schedules.create_or_update`, `red_teams.create`, and several model classes (`EvaluationRule`, `ContinuousEvaluationRuleAction`, `EvaluationRuleFilter`, `ProjectsSchedule`, `RecurrenceTrigger`, `EvaluationScheduleTask`, `RedTeam`, `AzureAIAgentTarget`) that are still moving in the preview SDK. Each script defensively falls back to the older `.create` surface when `.create_or_update` is missing, but new method renames will break us.

**Why deferred:** Foundry observability + red-team SDK is in active preview. Wrapping it now is the right call for audit-trail-in-Foundry, but we accept maintenance.

**Close-out:** A daily docs scan (Microsoft Learn MCP + Context7) flags the canonical method names; CI re-runs the wrappers against `azure-ai-projects` `latest` and pinned. Bump the pin window in `_common.py` + README in lockstep.

## TD-9 — Cloud red-team region list is hard-coded

**What:** [foundry-evals/scripts/ensure_redteam.py](.apm/skills/foundry-evals/scripts/ensure_redteam.py) hard-codes `SUPPORTED_REGIONS = {"eastus2", "francecentral", "swedencentral", "switzerlandwest", "northcentralus"}` as of 2026-05-14.

**Why deferred:** No public API exposes the supported region set programmatically.

**Close-out:** Daily docs scan against [Run AI Red Teaming Agent in the cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/how-to/develop/run-ai-red-teaming-cloud) updates the constant via PR. Until that lands, the script asks the human to verify.

## ~~TD-10 — Network detection scripts don't walk NSGs / Azure Firewall / SEPs~~ **(CLOSED in v0.20.0)**

**Status (v0.20.0):** Closed via the three-layer opt-in path documented in the close-out spec below.

**Shipped:**
- **Layer 1 — Deep walkers** (opt-in via `--deep`):
  - [scripts/network/deep-walk-nsg.sh](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/scripts/network/deep-walk-nsg.sh) — declared NSG rules + best-effort effective rules via `az network nic list-effective-network-security-rules`.
  - [scripts/network/deep-walk-firewall.sh](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/scripts/network/deep-walk-firewall.sh) — both classic application-rule collections and policy-based `ruleCollectionGroups`; FQDN-tag hints emitted.
  - [scripts/network/check-service-endpoint-policy.sh](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/scripts/network/check-service-endpoint-policy.sh) — flags SEP blocks on Foundry / Storage / AI Search service tags.
  - [scripts/network/check-source-network.sh](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/scripts/network/check-source-network.sh) extended with `--deep <agent_subnet_id> [<firewall_id>] [<fqdn>...]` to cascade the three walkers.
  - [`/prepare-deploy`](.apm/prompts/prepare-deploy.prompt.md) extended with `deep_network` input that wires `--deep` into the per-source loop.
- **Layer 2 — BYO VNet hand-off:** [scripts/network/templates/byo-vnet-with-pe.bicep](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/scripts/network/templates/byo-vnet-with-pe.bicep) — paste-ready VNet + delegated subnet + PE + Private DNS scaffold for `azd up`. The scripts emit a pointer to this file when `publicNetworkAccess=Disabled` and no PE is present.
- **Layer 3 — Troubleshooter runbook:** [foundry-prod-readiness/network-troubleshooter.md](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/network-troubleshooter.md) — symptom-triage table, full deep-walk command examples, DNS-from-Bastion fallback, and re-baseline command for `agent-status.json`.
- [networking.md](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/networking.md) "What the detection scripts deliberately leave to humans" section refreshed — Layer 1 now covered; remaining out-of-scope items (provisioning, cross-tenant peering, agent-side DNS) explicitly listed.

**Original gap:**

**What:** [foundry-prod-readiness/scripts/network/check-source-network.sh](.apm/skills/foundry-prod-readiness/scripts/network/check-source-network.sh) checks `publicNetworkAccess`, `networkAcls.defaultAction`, IP / VNet rule counts, and PE count — then prints "if NSG/Firewall is in place, verify outbound 443 manually".

**Why deferred:** Walking NSG rule chains, Azure Firewall application rules, and Service Endpoint Policies is high-maintenance and tenant-shape-specific. Most silent failures are caught by the four checks above + private DNS linkage; the residual is best handled by a human eyeball.

**Close-out (PR-ready spec, three layers):**

1. **Opt-in `--deep-network` flag** on `/prepare-deploy` (default off; slow path 60–120 s typical):
   - New script `scripts/network/deep-walk-nsg.sh <subnet-id>` — walks NSG rules on the agent's subnet *and* the source workload's subnet via `az network nic list-effective-network-security-rules`; checks outbound 443 against the canonical Foundry / source FQDNs declared in `agent-capabilities.yaml`.
   - New script `scripts/network/deep-walk-firewall.sh <firewall-id>` — enumerates Azure Firewall application rules via `az network firewall application-rule list` if a Firewall is detected in the route path.
   - New script `scripts/network/check-service-endpoint-policy.sh <subnet-id>` — `az network vnet subnet show --query serviceEndpointPolicies` to flag SEP blocks on Foundry / Storage / AI Search service tags.
   - Wire the three into `check-source-network.sh` behind a `--deep` flag so callers can keep the fast path by default.

2. **Known-good Bicep snippet emission** (closes the "detect → recommend → hand off" gap):
   - New file `scripts/network/templates/byo-vnet-with-pe.bicep` — minimal VNet + Private Endpoint + Private DNS zone in a known-good configuration for Foundry.
   - `check-source-network.sh` prints "drop this snippet into `./infra/main.bicep` and re-run `azd up`" when detection finds BYO VNet without a working PE. We don't run `az network create`; we hand off a paste-ready artifact.

3. **`network-troubleshooter.md` runbook** (converts unknown failures → known failure modes):
   - New doc `foundry-prod-readiness/network-troubleshooter.md` — step-by-step: "agent returns 503" → identify network class via `check-foundry-network-mode.sh` → re-run `check-source-network.sh --deep` → manual `curl` / `nslookup` from a Bastion host → link to the right Azure portal blade.
   - Cross-link from `foundry-prod-readiness/SKILL.md` failure-mode index and from the runbook-emit script.

**Trigger:** Multiple users hit silent NSG-block failures (was: "only if"); now elevated because Approach A Slide 4 of the exec deck claims this work; we should ship it on the same release that the deck is presented.

**Deck revisit required after merge:** Update Approach A Slide 4 ⚠ hand-off list — move "Network: VNet / PE / NSG provision" out of the ⚠ column for the `--deep` path; keep the runbook hand-off framing for the provision step. Update `00-objective-and-problem.md` validated facts to drop "network scripts are read-only detection only" once the `--deep` flag ships (note still applies to provisioning).

## TD-11 — ~~`agent-status.json` durable state is not yet implemented~~ (CLOSED in v0.11.0)

**What:** Per-agent durable record of identities, RBAC outcomes, network detection results, eval rule IDs, verify outcomes, and capability-hash baselines for drift detection.

**Status:** Closed in v0.11.0. Schema in [foundry-deploy/agent-status-schema.md](.apm/skills/foundry-deploy/agent-status-schema.md), helper in [foundry-deploy/scripts/agent_status.py](.apm/skills/foundry-deploy/scripts/agent_status.py). Three readers wired:
- `/prepare-deploy` — init + stamp `preflight` + `network` + baseline `drift.capability_hash_at_preflight`
- `/configure-rbac` — stamp `identities` + `rbac.phases_completed` + `rbac.capability_grants` + `rbac.pending` + re-baseline `drift.capability_hash_at_rbac`
- `/verify-agent` — drift check at Step −1, stamp `deploy` + `verify`

**Follow-ups (open as separate TDs when prioritized):**
- `/audit-drift` prompt (TD-12, planned) — 4th reader, surfaces declared-vs-observed deltas without mutating.
- Helper-side schema validation tightening (currently loose: section names enforced, fields free) when churn warrants — bump `schema_version` and ship a migration.

## TD-12 — ~~`/audit-drift` prompt~~ (CLOSED in v0.17.0)

**What:** Read-only declared-vs-observed reconciler. Walks `agent-capabilities.yaml` + the live world (Azure RBAC, Foundry connections, eval rules, Purview toggle, network class) and emits a markdown delta report. Never mutates.

**Status:** Closed in v0.17.0. Implementation: [.apm/prompts/audit-drift.prompt.md](.apm/prompts/audit-drift.prompt.md) (single prompt, no new scripts). Forward + reverse drift detection. Stamps `agent-status.json` `verify` block with `last_audit_at`, `audit_summary`, `audit_report_path` (additive — doesn't replace `/verify-agent`'s fields).

**Operational integration:**
- Documented in [recipes/02-brownfield-onboarding.md](../foundry-agent-fixtures/.apm/skills/foundry-agent-fixtures/recipes/02-brownfield-onboarding.md) Step 9 as the recommended weekly maintenance task.
- Designed for non-blocking CI scheduling — not a PR gate. (`/verify-agent` is the PR gate.)

## TD-13 — Brownfield code scan is regex-only (acceptable trade-off, tracked for visibility)

**What:** [foundry-knowledge/scripts/scan_knowledge_refs.py](.apm/skills/foundry-knowledge/scripts/scan_knowledge_refs.py) uses line-level regex against Python source files — not AST, not framework introspection. Misses: same-line aliased imports (`from azure.search.documents import SearchClient as SC`), conditional imports inside try/except, framework-specific tool registration patterns we don't have a regex for.

**Why this trade-off:** Per the agreed design, code scan is a *signal* not a source of truth — the scan always asks the user to confirm/edit, never silently classifies. AST-based scanning is a 5x complexity jump for marginal recall gain.

**Close-out:** Add an optional `--ast` flag using `ast` + framework-specific visitors only when (a) we hit multiple users with false negatives, or (b) we add support for a framework whose patterns are too dynamic for regex (e.g., DSPy).

## TD-14 — External persistence for Invocations agents (PLANNED — next-version roadmap)

**What:** Invocations-protocol hosted agents (webhook receivers, AG-UI streamers, batch processors) get NO platform-managed conversation history. The platform persists `agent_session_id` sandbox state for up to 30 days with a 15-minute idle timeout, but anything beyond that — cross-session user preferences, durable workflow state, multi-month chat histories — is the agent's responsibility.

**Why this matters now (and not for Responses):** Responses-protocol agents get `previous_response_id` / `conversation` autobind for free; the platform stores message history server-side. Invocations agents don't — because the payload shape is arbitrary, the platform can't infer what "history" means.

**Why deferred:** Three patterns that need separate sub-docs and per-pattern grant scripts (Cosmos DB, Redis, Storage Tables). Each requires capability-manifest schema extension (`persistence` block) + Phase A preflight + Phase B grants + Phase C verify. Full close is 5–7 files; not in scope for v0.16.0.

**Close-out plan (next-version roadmap):**
1. New sub-doc `foundry-deploy/external-persistence.md` covering decision matrix (do you actually need this?) + Cosmos / Redis / Storage Tables patterns + anti-pattern of treating `$HOME` as durable.
2. Schema extension: `persistence` block in `agent-capabilities.yaml` (optional; only declared by Invocations agents).
3. Per-store Phase B grant scripts under `foundry-deploy/scripts/persistence/` (or a new `foundry-state` skill if patterns grow).
4. `/configure-rbac` dispatch: Phase B grant per declared store (Cosmos data-plane role, Storage Blob Data Contributor, etc.).
5. `/verify-agent` Phase C: read/write a sentinel item end-to-end.

**Note:** This is distinct from the (also unscoped) `register-custom-agent` flow, which is for agents *running entirely outside Foundry* with Foundry just providing monitoring/eval. That's its own potential future skill (`foundry-control-plane` or similar).

## TD-15 — Microsoft Learn submission (PLANNED — post-1.0)

**What:** Submit the skillpack's content to Microsoft Learn (`learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/...`) for inclusion in the official Foundry hosted-agent documentation surface. Today this content is community-published via Astro Starlight + Azure Static Web Apps; Microsoft Learn would put it in the same place dev teams already look for Azure docs.

**Why deferred:** Microsoft Learn submission is a months-long process: content review, IP review, branding review, Microsoft assuming ownership of the URL and editorial cadence. It's the right destination eventually but not the right destination *yet* — the skillpack is iterating quickly against a preview-adjacent Foundry surface, and the Learn submission process trails active development by 6–12 months.

**Close-out plan (post-1.0):**
1. Wait until adoption justifies the submission cost (e.g., ≥ 100 stars, ≥ 5 distinct organizations using in production).
2. Identify a Microsoft sponsor for the submission (Foundry product team or Azure Apps + AI DX).
3. Author submission package: content, IP attestation, brand alignment.
4. Negotiate which content lives where (some content stays on the docs site as community extension; some moves to Learn as canonical).
5. Set up redirects from `foundry-agent-skillpack.example.com` to the Learn URLs for migrated pages.

**Until then:** the Astro Starlight site at `docs/` is the canonical render.

## TD-16 — Per-capability requirements snippets (PLANNED — when users complain)

**What:** Today, container-side Python dependencies needed per declared capability live in a single table in [foundry-deploy/runtime-dependencies.md](.apm/skills/foundry-deploy/runtime-dependencies.md). The user must read it, cross-reference their `agent-capabilities.yaml`, and manually append the right lines to their `requirements.txt`.

**Why deferred:** v0.18 ships with the single-page table because (a) it's enough for the current user count and (b) any automation that mutates user code is a stronger boundary than the skillpack has crossed. The cheap fix wins until real users complain.

**Close-out plan (when triggered):**
1. Per-capability `requirements-snippet.txt` files under each skill's `scripts/` folder (e.g., `foundry-guardrails/scripts/requirements-snippet.txt`, `foundry-knowledge/scripts/requirements-snippet.txt`).
2. New helper `foundry-deploy/scripts/inject-requirements.sh` — given an `agent-capabilities.yaml`, **prints** the lines to append (never mutates the user's file). Pattern: same posture as `runbook-emit.sh` — emit a paste-ready block.
3. `/prepare-deploy` Track H3 gate reports a delta: declared capabilities vs `requirements.txt` content; suggests the helper.
4. Document in `runtime-dependencies.md` § "How to update your existing requirements.txt".

**Triggers to start work:**
- Multiple users miss a runtime dep at deploy time (e.g., `ModuleNotFoundError` after `azd up`).
- A new capability is added that has non-obvious deps (TD-14 external persistence is a likely trigger).

## TD-17 — Docs site drift from skillpack sources (PHASE 1 SHIPPED in v0.18.0; Phase 2 post-1.0)

**What:** The docs site (`docs/src/content/docs/`) is a **curated subset** of the skillpack's skill content, not a mirror. Today:
- **Recipes** are mirrored automatically (`docs/scripts/mirror-recipes.mjs` runs on every dev/build).
- **Skills, prompts, TECHNICAL_DEBT, concept pages** are hand-curated and drift from the underlying sources.

**Why this matters:** small skill-level changes get made without updating the docs site, so the published documentation lags the actual skillpack behavior over time.

**Why a full mirror isn't the right answer (yet):**
- Skills are written for an LLM's context window (terse routers + sub-docs). Verbatim rendering on a docs site gives wall-of-text pages.
- Curated concept pages (`what-is-this.md`, `lifecycle.md`, etc.) are higher-quality than a raw skill mirror would produce.
- Heterogeneous skill shapes mean the mirror script would need per-skill rules.

**Status:**

*Phase 1 — Drift check script (SHIPPED in v0.18.0).*

Implementation:
- [`docs/scripts/check-drift.mjs`](../docs/scripts/check-drift.mjs) — set-difference check across three surfaces:
  - Skills directory ↔ `docs/src/content/docs/skills.md` table.
  - Prompts directory ↔ `docs/src/content/docs/reference/prompts.md`.
  - `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` `## TD-N` entries ↔ `docs/src/content/docs/technical-debt.md` table.
- CI integration in `.github/workflows/docs.yml`: a `Check for docs ↔ skillpack drift` step that runs before the build, emits the report to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, and is non-blocking (`continue-on-error: true`). PR reviewers see the report on the workflow run page.
- Output format: markdown report with ✅ / ⚠ per surface, plus a summary count.
- Exit code: always 0. The script is a nag, not a gate. By design.

What it deliberately doesn't do:
- No content-equality check. Paraphrased prose between source and docs is the whole point of a curated docs site; flagging every difference would be noise.
- No auto-fix. Drift is a human-review concern.
- No block-on-drift. PR authors get a heads-up; reviewer + author decide whether to update.

*Phase 2 — Mirror script for skills (post-1.0).*
1. `docs/scripts/mirror-skills.mjs` that mirrors **SKILL.md routers only** (not sub-docs) into `docs/src/content/docs/skills/<name>.md`.
2. Sub-docs continue to live in the skillpack; the docs-site skill page links to them on GitHub.
3. Curated concept pages stay hand-written — they're not mechanical mirrors.

**Operational note:** when you add or rename anything in `foundry-agent-skillpack/.apm/skills/`, the drift check will flag the gap in the next PR. Update the matching docs page (`skills.md`, `reference/prompts.md`, or `technical-debt.md`) in the same PR to close it.

## TD-18 — Foundry MCP lacks native `model_deployment_list` (OPEN — mitigated)

**What:** The Foundry MCP server exposes per-name `mcp_foundry_mcp_model_deployment_get` (returns 404 if the deployment is absent) but no list-by-account endpoint. `/plan-agent` Step 0b and `/prepare-deploy` Step 2.4 need to enumerate existing deployments in `target.foundry_account` to render a picklist.

**Status (mitigated, v0.19.0):** The skillpack routes through `mcp_azure_mcp_foundry` (action: `deployments.list`) for the enumeration call, then continues to use `mcp_foundry_mcp_model_deployment_get` for per-name validation and `mcp_foundry_mcp_model_deploy` for create. This split is documented in [foundry-deploy/model-selection.md](.apm/skills/foundry-deploy/model-selection.md) Step 1, with the rationale explicitly noted so future maintainers don't try to "consolidate" by hand-rolling REST calls.

**Why not full close:** Going through Azure MCP introduces a second tool dependency for what should be a single-MCP capability. It's a maintenance footnote, not a user-facing problem — both tools are stable and shipped.

**Close-out:** When Foundry MCP ships `mcp_foundry_mcp_model_deployment_list` (or equivalent), swap the call site in `model-selection.md` Step 1 and remove the cross-reference. One-file change. Track Foundry MCP release notes via the daily docs scan.

## TD-19 — Package rename `foundry-agent-harness` → `foundry-agent-skillpack` (OPEN — alias active)

**What:** v0.19.0 renames the package directory and all references from `foundry-agent-harness` to `foundry-agent-skillpack` (the second rename in this package's history; v0.18.0 was `engineering` → `harness`). To avoid breaking external consumers' `apm.yml dependencies:` blocks immediately, v0.19.0 ships `aliases: [foundry-agent-harness]` so `apm install` resolves the old name through the new package.

**Why deferred close:** The alias is a one-release courtesy. Keeping it forever would (a) leave two valid names in tooling output (`apm list` etc.), (b) keep stale references in consumer search results, and (c) blur the canonical name in support conversations.

**Consumer migration (one-line edit):**

```diff
 dependencies:
   apm:
-    - sathik11/Foundry-Hosted-Agent-Skill/foundry-agent-harness
+    - sathik11/Foundry-Hosted-Agent-Skill/foundry-agent-skillpack
```

The GitHub repo name (`Foundry-Hosted-Agent-Skill`) is unchanged, so existing clone URLs, raw-file links, and PR/issue history are unaffected.

**Close-out:** Remove the `aliases:` line from `foundry-agent-skillpack/apm.yml` in a follow-up release (slated for v0.20.x or v0.21.0; deferred past v0.20.0 so the alias survives the TD-2 + TD-10 close-out release). Bump major-or-minor per usual policy. Add a final-warning note to the release notes pointing here.
