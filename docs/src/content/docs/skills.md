title: Skills overview
description: Every skill the skillpack ships, what each one is for, and where to find its source.
---

The skillpack installs **15 engineering skills** + **1 fixtures-package skill** = 16 total. Each is a markdown router (`SKILL.md`) plus sub-docs and (where applicable) runnable scripts. Your coding agent loads the routers aggressively and treats sub-docs as on-demand reads.

Skill content is the canonical source — these pages link to it on GitHub for now. (Inline rendering in this site is on the roadmap.)

## Fixtures-package skill

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **foundry-agent-playbook** | Runnable fixtures + 6 end-to-end recipes — reference material; not loaded into agent context for normal use |

## Skill anatomy

Each engineering skill is a folder under `.apm/skills/foundry-<topic>/`:

```
foundry-<topic>/
├── SKILL.md            ← thin router with task table; loaded into context
├── <subtopic-1>.md     ← deep doc, loaded only when referenced
├── <subtopic-2>.md
├── scripts/            ← runnable code (shell, python, KQL, yaml)
└── templates/          ← scaffold templates (foundry-deploy only)
```

Why this split: agents load `SKILL.md` aggressively but treat sub-docs as on-demand reads. Keeping `SKILL.md` thin (≤ 50 lines, mostly a table + cross-refs) lowers the load-time cost. Sub-docs grow without penalty.
