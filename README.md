# Foundry Agent Skillpack

> **The end-to-end skillpack for Microsoft Foundry hosted agents.** Plan, deploy, govern, evaluate, and audit hosted and prompt agents on Foundry — with persona-aware preflight, durable per-agent state, and a read-only drift detector.

> **v0.20.0 repo rename.** The GitHub repo was renamed from `Foundry-Hosted-Agent-Skill` to [`foundry-agent-skillpack`](https://github.com/sathik11/foundry-agent-skillpack) to match the primary package name. GitHub auto-redirects old URLs. The engineering package was previously renamed from `foundry-agent-harness` → `foundry-agent-skillpack` in v0.19.0; `aliases: [foundry-agent-harness]` still ships through this release (slated to drop in v0.24 — see [TD-19](./foundry-agent-skillpack/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md#td-19--package-rename-foundry-agent-harness--foundry-agent-skillpack)).

## What this is

Two installable APM packages plus a hosted documentation site:

- **`foundry-agent-skillpack/`** — engineering skillpack: 15 skills, 9 slash commands, convergent lifecycle scripts for eval / red-team / drift detection, vendored runtime middleware (guardrails + Purview DLP), per-agent durable state.
- **`foundry-agent-playbook/`** — opt-in: 2 runnable samples (`learn-agent`, `langgraph-chat-sample`) and 6 end-to-end recipes covering greenfield, brownfield, knowledge + Purview, AI Search + scheduled eval, APIM-fronted MCP, and multi-agent orchestration.
- **`docs/`** — Astro Starlight site rendered to Azure Static Web Apps.

## Prerequisites

Fresh laptop? Run the one-liner. On macOS, Debian/Ubuntu, or WSL2 Ubuntu:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sathik11/foundry-agent-skillpack/main/scripts/install-prereqs.sh | bash
```

It detects what's installed, installs only what's missing, prints exactly what you must still do manually (`az login`, RBAC role check, subscription pick). Re-running is safe. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--no-python`, `--no-azd`.

**Windows users:** the skillpack's scripts are bash. **Use WSL2** (`wsl --install`, then run the curl one-liner inside WSL). Native Windows support via PowerShell siblings is under evaluation — see [TD-28](./foundry-agent-skillpack/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md#td-28--cross-os-script-runtime--bash--pwsh-dual-script-bake-off). Git Bash is **not** supported (path-mangling + `python3` aliasing issues bite our scripts).

What gets installed: `apm` (check only), `az` (≥ 2.80), `azd` (≥ 1.24) + `azd ai agent` extension, `jq`, `python3.12+`. Full per-tool justification: [docs → install → prerequisites](https://foundry-agent-skillpack.example.com/getting-started/install/#prerequisites).

## Install

```bash
# 0. (One-time) Initialize apm.yml so APM knows where to deploy skills + prompts.
#    Idempotent — only writes if apm.yml is missing.
[ -f apm.yml ] || cat > apm.yml <<'EOF'
name: my-foundry-project
version: 0.0.1
targets:
  - copilot
  - agent-skills
  - claude
  - cursor
  - windsurf
  - codex
  - gemini
  - opencode
EOF

# 1. Engineering skillpack — knowledge + prompts + scripts
apm install sathik11/foundry-agent-skillpack/foundry-agent-skillpack

# 2. Optional but recommended: playbook (samples + recipes)
apm install sathik11/foundry-agent-skillpack/foundry-agent-playbook
```

> **Already have `apm.yml`?** Add a `targets:` line if missing — APM CLI no longer auto-defaults to `copilot` and refuses to install without one. See [docs → Install → Troubleshooting](https://foundry-agent-skillpack.example.com/getting-started/install/#troubleshooting--no-harness-detected).

After install you'll see:

```
.agents/skills/                    ← 16 skills (15 engineering + 1 fixtures)
.github/prompts/                   ← 9 slash commands
.github/agents/                    ← 1 agent persona
```

## How we fit alongside Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit (AGT)

[Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) is the runtime governance layer for AI agents. This skillpack is the **deploy + lifecycle orchestration** layer for Foundry hosted agents. **They sit on different layers of the same stack and are intended to be used together** — AGT lists Azure AI Foundry as one of its supported deployment targets; we are the layer that gets Foundry agents deployed correctly before AGT wraps their tool calls at runtime.

| Dimension | AGT (runtime middleware) | This skillpack (deploy + lifecycle) |
|---|---|---|
| **When in the lifecycle** | Inside the agent container, per tool call | Before `azd up` and across post-deploy operations |
| **Distribution** | Library (`pip install agent-governance-toolkit[full]` — also npm / NuGet / cargo / go) | APM package consumed by coding agents (`apm install …`) |
| **What it produces** | `GovernanceDenied` exception + Merkle audit record at runtime | Foundry `EvaluationRule` / `RedTeam` resources · APIM Bicep · Entra Agent ID · per-capability RBAC · `agent-status.json` · drift detection |
| **Cloud** | Multi-cloud (Azure / AWS / GCP / Docker) | Foundry-specific |
| **Framework** | 14+ adapters (MAF, Semantic Kernel, AutoGen, LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK, …) | Foundry-native + `agent-framework` + LangGraph BYO templates |
| **Primary user** | Application developer writing agent code | DevOps / AI engineer deploying + governing agents on Foundry |
| **Identity model** | SPIFFE / DID / mTLS (cross-cloud zero-trust primitive) | Entra Agent ID + Foundry project/agent/application identity flip + per-capability RBAC dispatcher |
| **What it does NOT do** | Provision Azure resources · grant RBAC · configure Foundry capabilities · orchestrate Teams publish | Intercept tool calls at runtime · enforce per-action policy · provide cross-framework / cross-cloud SDK |

**Adopt-and-integrate plan (tracked under [TD-29](./foundry-agent-skillpack/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md#td-29--agt-runtime-governance-as-a-declarable-layer-open---v024-candidate)):**

- A future `agent-capabilities.yaml` will accept `runtime_governance: agt` as a declarable layer alongside the existing `middleware` / `content_safety` / `purview_dlp` / `redteam_evals` options.
- When declared, `/prepare-deploy` injects `agent-governance-toolkit[full]` into the agent's container `requirements.txt`, the skillpack's agent templates wrap declared tool functions with `govern(...)`, and the Foundry-native eval rules we provision cross-link to AGT policy decisions through OTel spans.
- `foundry-guardrails` skill will cross-reference AGT as the recommended runtime layer for tool-call governance (today our guardrails layers cover content safety + DLP, not arbitrary action policy).

**Use both when:** you want Foundry-native eval/RBAC/identity orchestration (this skillpack) *and* deterministic per-tool-call deny + tamper-evident audit at runtime (AGT). This is the recommended posture for production Foundry hosted agents.

## What runs in your tenant vs. ours

| Layer | Provider |
|---|---|
| Image build, agent create, version create, identity assignment | `azd ai agent` extension (you run it) |
| Per-capability preflight, RBAC dispatch, drift detection | This skillpack's prompts (your coding agent runs them) |
| Foundry-native eval rules, scheduled eval, cloud red-team | Convergent lifecycle scripts in this skillpack (`ensure_*` pattern) |
| Runtime guardrails (middleware, Content Safety, Purview DLP) | Vendored Python middleware — copied into your agent's container |
| Knowledge sources, MCP servers, network class | Your Azure resources; skillpack verifies and grants RBAC |

## Where to start

| You are… | Read |
|---|---|
| New to Foundry hosted agents — building from scratch | [Recipe 01 — Greenfield Quickstart](foundry-agent-playbook/.apm/skills/foundry-agent-playbook/recipes/01-greenfield-quickstart.md) |
| Already have working agent code, want to host it on Foundry | [Recipe 02 — Brownfield Onboarding](foundry-agent-playbook/.apm/skills/foundry-agent-playbook/recipes/02-brownfield-onboarding.md) |
| Want to validate the package end-to-end against a real Foundry project | [TESTING_SCENARIOS.md](TESTING_SCENARIOS.md) |
| Just want to smoke-test that `apm install` works | [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) |

## What's coming

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Highlights for the next minor release:

- **TD-14 — External persistence for Invocations agents** (Cosmos / Redis patterns).
- **Daily docs-scan workflow** (catches Foundry preview drift).
- **`/setup-evals` writes to `agent-status.json` `evals` block**.

## What this is not

- Not a runtime. Your agent runs in Foundry's container; the skillpack is build/deploy/audit-time only.
- Not a replacement for `azd ai agent`. The skillpack validates and dispatches; `azd up` deploys.
- Not Microsoft-published. Community work tracking the Foundry hosted-agent surface — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the path to Microsoft Learn submission.
